<p>I am Jashwanth(Jess), A CS Undergraduate from IIIT Hyderabad '21. I have
 worked as a Software Analyst in Goldman Sachs Inc., for roughy 2 years now. 
 Now for the next phase of my life, I am planning to pursue masters in CS at 
 Stony Brook University, NY for Fall' 23. Keeping aside my professional life,
 I'm hoping that people around me do feel that I am a chill dude whom you can
 reach out to have a silly conversation over a cup of coffee or have a deep 
 conversation about life philosophies over a pitcher! Either ways, I manage 
 to give and have a great time :)</p>

<p>This page is created in the ego of a computer science grad not having a
 personal website. Although, the main purpose of creating this personal site
 is for me to write some blogs, I would also like to brag my technical skills. 
 I am planning to put out some interesting stuff in the blogs where the topics
 range from tech stuff to deep 3am philosophical thoughts. Do visit the page if
 you are already a victim of mindless scrolling in social media because more or
 less thats what you ould be doing on my blogs too. Cheers! </p>
